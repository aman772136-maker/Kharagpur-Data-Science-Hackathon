# Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon 2025
## Track A: Systems Reasoning with NLP and Generative AI

### 🔍 Problem Statement
Build an AI reasoning system that:
- Processes **long text data (novels, narratives, docs)** using NLP
- Stores and indexes data into vector memory
- Retrieves best evidence for user query
- Applies logical reasoning via LLM
- Generates correct, grounded answers
- **Mandatory:** Uses **Pathway Python framework** in pipeline stage

---

### 🧠 Solution Pipeline
1. **Data ingestion using Pathway**
2. **Text chunking & embedding generation**
3. **Vector DB storage & semantic search**
4. **Evidence reranking**
5. **LLM reasoning & answer generation**
